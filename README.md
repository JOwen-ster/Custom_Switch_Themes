> [!Tip]
> Use **SwitchLayoutEditor** to `edit properties` and then `generate a layout diff` (Tools -> Layout diff -> Select your `untouched` **.szs** file (MainMenu, Lockscreen, Settings, etc...) -> Select your `edited` **.szs** copy file derived from your un-touched base)

> [!Tip]
> In **SwitchThemeInjector**, select your newly created layout (the file generated from layout diff) to `build a nxtheme`. You can specify a layout patch (your layout diff file), a commons file, a background.jpg, and any/all icon.png), you can also use the presets in the dropdown menus or not use any present all together and just select a 1280x720 image to build a theme that has no other changes other than the background image.

> ***OR***
> 
> Use **SwitchThemeInjector** to `extract the components from an existing` .nxtheme file to edit the JSON to your liking!
